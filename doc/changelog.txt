HFSExplorer Changelog
---------------------


current
-------
- Change: HFSExplorer now hides specially protected files and directories by
  default. The affected files and directories are the file and directory inode
  directories ("\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000HFS+ Private Data" /
  ".HFS+ Private Directory Data\u000d") and the journal files
  (".journal_info_block" / ".journal").

- Bugfix: Modify date now set when extracting files.

- Bugfix: HFSCommonFileSystemRecognizer failed when operating on devices
  requiring aligned I/O.

- Bugfix: int overflow bug in caching layer led to OutOfMemoryError in
  certain situations when reading large disks.


0.21
----
- Feature: New command line utility unhfs added which makes it possible to extract the
  contents of an HFS/HFS+/HFSX file system from the command line. Run
  unhfs.bat/unhfs.sh for instructions on how to use it.
  Thanks to Sebastian Lisken for suggesting this utility and participating in its
  development.

- Feature: Ability to view and extract the contents of resource forks built into the
  file information dialog (will only appear if there is resource fork data in the file).
  Also available as an external program, Resource Viewer, which will appear on the start
  menu for Windows users, and can be accessed through the startup script
  resview.bat/resview.sh for other users.

- Feature: New File menu item "Load file system from path" added, enabling users to type
  the pathname to a device file or disk image instead of having to select it with the
  file chooser dialog. This makes it a lot easier to load devices in Mac OS X and *nix
  systems.

- Improvement: Increased compatibility with devices that are unwilling to state their
  size, such as certain iPod devices attached to Windows systems.

- Symlink bugfix: Symlinks referring to themselves caused infinite recursion and
  StackOverflowError.

- HFS bugfix: Incorrect structure definition for CdrFilRec led to an inability to
  extract resource forks and fragmented files.

- Bugfix: Proper resource fork file format now generated when extracting resource forks.
  The earlier versions extracted resource forks as raw resource data, which is
  incompatible with Mac OS X. Now proper AppleDouble format files are generated, making
  the resource forks readable through SMB network shares when mounted by Mac OS X.


0.20.1
------
- Bugfix: The status field in the main window could expand vertically.

- Installer fix: Uninstalls current version before installing new one.

- Mac OS X fix: Dock icon gets set to the HFSExplorer icon.

- Bugfix: Some annoying debug messages were printed in the debug console.


0.20
----
- Experimental support for reading encrypted UDIF/raw disk images (.dmg). Feedback is
  much appreciated, as I can only generate a certain amount of test cases.

- Experimental support for older HFS (Mac OS Original) file systems. Feedback is much
  appreciated here as well.

- Support for hard links, both to files and directories (yes, HFS+ supports directory
  hard links, but so far Apple only uses them for the purpose of Time Machine backups).

- Support for POSIX-style symbolic links.

- Ability to create a read/write disk image (.dmg) from a loaded file system.

- Java 6+ only: Table header sorting for the file table is now implemented. The last
  (empty) column will sort on the internal sort order, if you need to reset your sorting
  choices.

- More flexible extract options, such as setting default actions for different events
  that may occur. (Example: "Could not create directory" -> Skip / Auto-rename / ...)

- Major restructuring/modularization of core components to ease future development.

- Bugfix: Thread safety is now a reality within HFSExplorer. The extract progress dialog
  no longer needs to be modal.

- Bugfix: Specifying a device path as argument when launching the app failed previously
  due to incorrect assumptions about input data.

- Bugfix: Caching layer was suffering from a logic error, mostly encountered when reading
  very small filesystems (such as disk images), which then could not be loaded.

- Bugfix: Autodetect failed for some MBR partitioned drives.

- Bugfix: Corrected a small rounding error that affected the last digit of displayed file
  sizes, making 4,5 KiB files appear as 5 KiB files instead of 4 KiB (only affected what
  was presented to the user, and none of the internal workings). Whether this is the
  correct way of displaying a file size is arguable, but it's a floor estimate, and
  usually much more usable.

- Bugfix: The user previously wasn't able to abort the "Calculating selection size" phase
  when extracting files.

- Bugfix/feature: When extracting resource forks or both forks, empty resource forks are
  now skipped over, rather than being extracted as 0-byte "._" files.


0.19.5
------
- HFSX support can be considered stable as I have got no reports on any related problems.

- Bugfix/feature: GPT tables are now explicitly included in the Autodetect scan in the
  Windows dialog "Load file system from device". If you have a broken MBR but a valid
  GPT, the GPT partitions will be automatically detected.

- Made the Volume info panel a bit more detailed and replaced JLabels with JTextFields so
  information easily can be marked up and copied.

- Added two options in the popup menu displayed when user right clicks a file/folder:
  - Extract data
  - Extract data and resource fork(s)

- Extract progress window now always closes when user clicks the window's close button,
  even though the extraction process might not have ended. This enables the user to do
  error checking if extraction hangs.

- Windows: Added support for 64-bit JVMs (compiled code now exists for x86_64 and
  Itanium, though only x86_64 has been tested).

- Launcher improvements and various small bug fixes to cope with 64-bit Windows and WOW64.

- Converted the ever-disabled "Back" button into an "Up"-button to walk upwards (towards
  the root) in the directory tree.

- Added support for more than 20 partitions per drive, more than 20 drives and more than
  20 CD-ROMs in "Load file system from device" dialog (not that anyone has actually
  needed to use that many, but why impose limitations when you don't really have to?).

- "Open file" in Windows is now much more usable due to invoking the Windows handler
  instead of using the Java6 openFile handler when available.

- Fixed a few user interface bugs and quirks.


0.19
----
- Feature: Experimental support for HFSX formatted volumes (Mac OS Extended with case
  sensitive filenames). Feedback is appreciated for those with HFSX volumes.

- Feature: Implemented a caching layer between the file system handler and the media.
  This makes copying from CDs and DVDs a lot faster, and potentially speeds up operations
  on other media (hard disks, disk images) as well.

- Feature: bzip2 compressed UDIF .dmg files can now be opened.

- Bugfix: Annoying GUI behavior when extracting files with long file names.

- Cosmetic fix: Background is now consistently white in the file list pane.

- License change: GPL version 2 to GPL version 3.


0.18.3
------
- Bugfix: Parsing of Driver Descriptor Records and GUID Partition Tables could bail out for
  unexpected values when detecting partition systems, leading to exceptions when trying to
  load file systems.

- Bugfix: The launcher, hfsexplorer.exe, had a bug leading to access violation and crash
  under some circumstances due to a non null-terminated string being generated.


0.18.2
------
- Bugfix/feature: Windows autodetect button now handles APM partitioned drives/CDs as well.

- Bugfix: HFSExplorer now works with large Apple Partition Map and MBR partitioned drives.

- Bugfix: Update check now checks for build number instead of version number.


0.18.1
------
- Implemented support for wrapped HFS+ volumes (HFS+ volumes wrapped inside HFS volumes, as in
  http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSWrapper).

- Fixed a minor bug where the user wasn't notified when a file could not be opened.


0.18
----
- Huge rework of the libraries from DMGExtractor, due to a lot of wasted memory leading to
  OutOfMemoryError for huge DMG files. Particulary the XML parser has been seriously
  reconstructed. Tested with an 11 GiB compressed/25 GiB uncompressed UDIF disk image.

- Fixed a serious bug leading to a lot of files not beeing seen by HFSExplorer (though I didn't
  notice it myself). Had to do with the algorithm that collected all files in a directory.
  (thanks to Mark Wainwright for the valuable test case)

- Implemented a Unicode composition algorithm, for those who have been experiencing strange
  filenames whenever there are accents and umlauts in them. (thanks to Wolf Mc Even for info)

- Improved repsonsiveness and usefulness for the progress dialog displayed when extracting
  files from the file system.

- Improved efficiency when reading UDIF disk images (.dmg files). (In some cases probably up to
  a million times faster... ;> ) 

- Implemented double-clicking in the right pane to browse a directory, or to extract (or open),
  a file.

- Implemented right-clicking in the left and right pane for bringing up a popup menu. Currently
  the only option is "Information", which brings up the info window.

- Made the partition choosing dialog default to the first HFS partition found.

- Fixed a bug when running the application in OS X, related to JFileChooser (all in all,
  JFileChooser seems very buggy in OS X).

- Fixed a non critical bug with HFSPlusBSDInfo. Apparently some root nodes (CNID 2) have a
  special value for "file mode", 0x0, not mentioned in POSIX and such specs (not that I have
  read them, but I assume...) so file info for the root node could not be displayed..

- UI is no longer active while the program loads a file at startup (could be confusing when
  loading large files, where the user might have thought that no operation was in progress)

- Added a debug console window where all the output from System.out and System.err goes when
  the application is running in pure windowed mode.

- Added icons for .dmg files in Windows Explorer. (for source material, thanks to the original
  creator of the icon for GParted, whoever that is...)


0.17
----
- DMG UDIF file support! Most DMG files can now be read directly from within HFSExplorer (no
  prior extraction needed), thanks to integrating code from DMGExtractor. It is all rather slow
  at the moment (especially with compressed images), but expect performance enhancements in the
  future when I implement smarter buffering/caching.
  What is known not to work are .dmg files with ADC or BZIP2 compression and encrypted images.
  Additionally, any image that does not contain an HFS+ file system will obviously not work.

- Created a launcher application for Windows, which automatically locates the Java Runtime
  Environment and starts the application from an .exe file. This launcher might work poorly
  with JREs from other vendors than Sun, so feedback is appreciated from those using non-Sun
  Java Runtime Environments.

- Made a NSIS installer package for Windows users, making it easy to install/uninstall the
  application. The installer is able to create file associations with .dmg files.

- Enabled the address field and "Go" button in HFSExplorer (after many releases where it has
  been disabled, waiting for implementation).

- Title bar now shows which file is open.


0.16
----
- Added automatic detection of partition systems and file systems, so that the user no longer
  needs to worry about whether it should choose to load them with or without APM.

- Added support for the MBR and GUID Partition Table partitioning schemes, making access to
  raw disk images or devices from Intel systems possible. (Not very tested, might be buggy...)

- Added an "autodetect" button to the "Load file system from device" dialog (only for Windows
  users), so that the user doesn't have to look for the correct device itself.

- Added a progress dialog when extracting files, so that users get some info on what's going on.

- Added keyboard shortcuts to menu items.

- Added a menu item to check for newer versions of HFSExplorer.

- Behavior change: When the program encounters an exception while extracting files (for example
  when the disk is full), the user can now choose to abort the entire extraction, or continue.

- Fixed a bug leading to exceptions when failing to load a file system, requiring a restart
  of the program.


0.15.1
------
- Minor Windows Vista fix. The icons were not found when starting HFSExplorer with the
  runfsb_vista.vbs script. Now the icons are included in the JAR file, so they should always
  be available.


0.15
----
- Major UI overhaul with a few icons, changed appearance of the file list. Many things left
  to do though.

- Added information dialogs for presenting information about the volume header, the catalog
  file, detailed file and folder info, some minor info on the journal... (all in preparation
  for future development work on write support)

- Behavior change: Extract button now extracts the entry that was last in focus. If you
  selected a folder in the left pane most recently, that folder will be extracted and not the
  selection in the right pane (and vice versa).

- Fixed a bug submitted by Gennadiy Bukhmatov related to the behavior of
  org.catacombae.hfsexplorer.types.OSType.

- Added a start script for Windows Vista, automatically bringing up the UAC dialog. It has not
  been tested more than that, so please mail me about your experiences with Windows Vista.
  Vista users may run "runfsb_vista.vbs"...


0.11
----
- Fixed a very significant bug, sometimes leading to some files not being seen by HFSExplorer,
  and sometimes leading to a complete crash.

- Made extraction of multiple files, as well as directory trees possible.

- Fixed some uncaught exception when trying to read an Apple Partition Map when it isn't there.

- First release of source code.
